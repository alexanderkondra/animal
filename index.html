          <h2 >Lion (King of Jungle)</h2> <p>
              <img class="col-md-12" src="img/lion.jpg" alt="Lion">Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p>

          <h2 >Snow Leopard (King of High Mountain)</h2> <p>
            <img class="col-md-12" src="img/snowleo.jpg" alt="Snow Leopard">Snow leopards are highly adapted to their home in the cold high mountains. Their thick fur patterned with dark rosettes and spots (a pattern that is unique to each individual snow leopard) is the perfect camouflage for their rocky habitat, allowing them to stalk their prey.</p>
